Code compiles and runs as expected. There are some usability issues with movement and the way
that items display, but nothign too significant.

## Show Code #9 (4 of 4 points)

It appears that a lot of combat is in place, though it is still buggy. When I attacked another player who
didn't have a weapon it killed me pretty much instantly. Not certain what happened with that. Trying to kill
and NPC didn't seem to do much of anything.

You didn't include the heap, but you put the line in the ActivityManager and you included a score in
the graphic game.
