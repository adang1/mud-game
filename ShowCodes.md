Code compiles and runs as expected. There are some usability issues with movement and the way
that items display, but nothign too significant.

## Show Code #9 (4 of 4 points)

It appears that a lot of combat is in place, though it is still buggy. When I attacked another player who
didn't have a weapon it killed me pretty much instantly. Not certain what happened with that. Trying to kill
and NPC didn't seem to do much of anything.
